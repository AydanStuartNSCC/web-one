        <p>
            I was born in <strong>Vancouver</strong>, and I have lived there until 2007 when i moved to
            <strong>Ottawa</strong>
            and was there for around 6 years until 2013 when my family moved back to B.C for 2 year until we had to move
            again
            <strong>Halifax.</strong> After graduating high school in 2021, i decided to take the AMCA program to expand
            my horizons in what i wanted to do. after that i applied into Graphic and Print Production because of the
            hands on experience that it provides and the oppurtunties that it provides. So after finishing the program I
            made the decision to enroll in Graphic Design to improve my skills, and become a better designer than i
            already am right now.
